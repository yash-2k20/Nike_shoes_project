                    <p>Nike, Inc., formerly (1964–78) Blue Ribbon Sports, American sportswear
                        company headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon. It was founded in 1964 as Blue Ribbon
                        Sports by Bill Bowerman, a track-and-field coach at the University of Oregon, and his former
                        student Phil Knight. They opened their first retail outlet in 1966 and launched the Nike
                        brand shoe in 1972. The company was renamed Nike, Inc., in 1978 and went public two
                        years later. By the early 21st century, Nike had retail outlets and distributors in more than
                        170 countries, and its logo—a curved check mark called the “swoosh”—was recognized
                        throughout the world.
                        From the late 1980s Nike steadily expanded its business and diversified its
                        product line through numerous acquisitions, including the shoe companies Cole Haan (1988;
                        sold in 2012) and Converse, Inc. (2003), the sports-equipment producer Canstar Sports, Inc.
                        (1994; later called Bauer and sold in 2008), and the athletic apparel and equipment
                        company Umbro (2008; sold in 2012). In 1996 the company created Nike ACG (“allconditions
                        gear”), which markets products for extreme sports such as snowboarding and
                        mountain biking. In the early 21st century Nike began selling sports-technology accessories,
                        including portable heart-rate monitors and high-altitude wrist compasses.

                        <p>As Michael Jordan entered his rookie year in 1984, he was approached to
                            sign a shoe deal with Adidas, Converse, and Nike. In their meeting with Jordan, Nike
                            centered its presentation around a highlight video of Jordan's various slam dunks, scored to
                            "Jump (For My Love)" by the Pointer Sisters. Nike showcased the first design of the shoe,
                            but Jordan criticized its colorway. While other companies saw Jordan as a figure for
                            promoting preexisting shoe lines, Nike took Jordan's criticism into account to make him "a
                            stand alone star and give him a signature shoe line.
                            On October 26, 1984, Michael Jordan signed a five-year, US$2.5 million deal
                            with Nike, three times more than any other deal in the National Basketball Association
                            (NBA) at the time. Nike released the Air Jordan sneaker line in April 1985 with the goal of
                            making $3 million in the first three years. Sales greatly exceeded expectations, earning
                            $126
                            million in one year.
                            The NBA policy stated that the shoes must be 51% white and in accordance
                            with the shoes that the rest of the team was wearing. Failure to follow this policy resulted
                            in
                            a $5,000 fine per game. Nike designed the Air Jordan I based on the Chicago Bulls' red and
                            black team colors with only 23% white, which violated the NBA's policy. Nike agreed to pay
                            each fine, garnering both controversy and publicity around the shoe.Fines imposed by the
                            NBA on Jordan for wearing the shoes bestowed upon them an iconic brand and was later
                            regarded as groundbreaking in part due to its defiance of NBA regulations.
